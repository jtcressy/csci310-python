# Kattis Problems for Project 2
## CSCI 310 Python - Fall 2017

All of these problems can be ran by running ``python3 -m kattis.<problem name>`` in the terminal


1. snappereasy / snapperhard
    - This was pretty easy once you figure out the math part. Some people might have iterated through this, but that
    would’ve driven me mad. I’d say the solution is 10/10. I feel confident on it.
2. anewalphabet
    - 10/10 on this, used the map function to rewrite the the inputted line as I iterated through it using a convert
    function and a dictionary of the replacements.
3. backspace
    - 10/10. I already solved this in C++, so I just adapted my code. Treated the list() class as a sort of stack to
    buffer the output.
4. addingwords
    - The Repl class may be unnecessary, but it was handy to organize it and it was kind of fun treating functions
    like variables.
5. anagramcounting
    - Oh boy. This one was tough. This also almost drove me off the edge because python3 handles floats differently than python2. As a result, you can only pass this problem if you run your code in python2.
    - So, for this do ``python2 -m kattis.anagramcounting`` to get the result that kattis wants.
    - It works, so at least a 9/10 on this one?
